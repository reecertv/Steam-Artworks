## How to use these Artwork Covers?

It's simple.

Just download the newest release and unzip all the files. Then open Steam. In Steam: Library > HOME (upper left corner) > Right Click on any Cover (If you can't see a Cover, you have to add a new Shelf) > Manage > Set Custom Artwork. Then you have to select the downloaded files. That's it.
